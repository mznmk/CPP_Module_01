42 is a private, nonprofit and tuition-free computer science school created and funded by French billionaire Xavier Niel (founder of the telecommunication company Iliad) with several partners including Nicolas Sadirac (previous director-general of the Epitech school in France),[1] Kwame Yamgnane and Florian Bucher (former executives of Epitech).
[2] The school was first opened in Paris in 2013.

42 is a future-proof computer science training to educate the next generation of software engineers.

Out of more than 80,000 candidates in France, 3,000[3] were selected to complete a four-week intensive computer programming bootcamp called piscine (swimming-pool).
Any person older than 16 can register for the piscine after completing the logical reasoning tests on the website.

The school does not have any professors, and is open 24/7.
The training includes peer-to-peer, pedagogy, and project-based learning.
All the intellectual property belongs to the students.

42's name is a reference to the science fiction book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy written by British author Douglas Adams: in the book 42 is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
